/**
 * Copy this class file into your USERID.hw1 and modify it (and instrument other classes) so you
 * can produce a table that counts the number of multiplications/divisions and additions/subtractions
 * within:
 * 
 * (A) MatrixMultiply      [I have done this for you already]
 * (B) Strassen            [You need to COPY this file into your USERID.hw1 and instrument the code]
 * (C) DeterminantMatrix   [I have done this for you already]
 * 
 * NOTE: THE OUTPUT TABLE IS UNUSAL because the rows are all separated by 256 instead of the regular DOUBLING
 *       that you will see in class. I have done this for a reason, however, and you should find out why
 *       when you read the instructions.
